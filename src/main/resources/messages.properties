#Property Name
# ex: yourObjectName.objectField

employee.firstName = First Name
employee.lastName = Last Name

#Pattern
# ValidationAnnotationName.yourObjectName.objectField

NotBlank.employee.firstName = {0} is a required field.
# {0} captures value of ^^ (Employee.firstName) variable

Size.employee.firstName = {0} can have max {1} and min {2} characters.
#   {1}, {2}, etc. are like index #s for parameters inside your annotations
#       inside your Object class (Employee)

NotBlank.employee.lastName = {0} is a required field.
